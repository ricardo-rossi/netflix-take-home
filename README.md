# GitHub Browser (take-home assignment)

# Overview

## Functional Requirements

> Take-Home Exercise:
  Build a simple interactive UI to display a list of an arbitrary user-specified organization's GitHub projects ranked by any meaningful metric you'd like, and allow the user to browse recent commits on that project.
  
>  For instance, one metric could be popularity, which could be derived via the number of forks. In this case, the UI would list Netflix's public repositories with Hystrix on top, followed by SimianArmy, followed by eureka, etc. GitHub offers an intuitive RESTful API to do this.
  
>  You can use any web framework you'd like; please provide instructions on how to build and run your web app.
 
>  If you normally develop with automated tests, please include them; otherwise please include a short list of manual tests. 

>  In terms of level of effort and prioritization around code elegance, presentation polish, and UI/UX thoughtfulness, we expect this will take no more than about five hours, depending on how much work you want to put into it.  Think of this as "I need to put something up that my users will actually be using on a daily basis, but I don't have days and days to work on it" as a general way to think about your final product. We don't expect you to give us something back within a day â€“ we know, and appreciate the fact you've got a busy life and a job.
